# AI-pbl
As AI is our core Subject. I have done one PBL (Project-based learning). Here I have created a Project in Artificial Intelligence. I have created a Maze solver using the "Heuristic Function". 
--> First we have created a board with some stop pits.
--> Then created a function to find the exit point in the maze.
--> The pits stops are represented by 0 and 1 i.e, 0 says the block where it cant go further from it. 1 says it has the way to further to reach the end point.
